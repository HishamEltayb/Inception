# Inception Installation Guide for Alpine Linux


## Prerequisites
Before running the installation script, ensure that you have the following setup:

- A virtual machine (VM) running **Alpine Linux**.
- Network ports configured:
  - **443:443** for Nginx
  - **42:42** for SSH between the host and the guest
- `curl` must be installed on your system.

## Installing Curl
If `curl` is not installed, you can install it using the following command:
```sh
su -c "apk add curl"
```

## Downloading the Installation Script
To download the installation script, run the following command:
```sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HishamEltayb/Inception/refs/heads/master/install_alpine/install.sh
```

## Setting Up Execution Permissions
Once downloaded, modify the file permissions to make it executable:
```sh
chmod +x install.sh
```

## Running the Installation Script
Execute the script with superuser privileges:
```sh
su  -c 'sh install.sh'
```

## Notes
- Alpine Linux uses `doas` instead of `sudo` by default for privilege escalation
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the script
- Double-check that your VM's network settings are correctly configured before running the script
- If you encounter any issues, verify that `curl` is properly installed and your VM network ports are correctly mapped


## SSH Configuration (macOS)

To enable easy SSH access to your Alpine VM from your Mac, add the following configuration to your SSH config file:

```ssh-config
Host alpine-vm
    HostName localhost
    User <your-alpine-username>
    Port 42
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

You can add this configuration by running:

```bash
cat << EOF >> ~/.ssh/config
Host alpine-vm
    HostName localhost
    User <your-alpine-username>
    Port 42
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
EOF
```

After adding this configuration, you can connect to your VM simply by running:
```bash
ssh alpine-vm
```
